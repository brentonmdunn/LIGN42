    <div><LB /><h2><span>Articulatory Dynamics
    </span></h2>
    
    
    Skibidi (/ˈskɪ.bɪ.di/): Words like "skibidi" (/ˈskɪ.bɪ.di/) also have some interesting articulatory dynamics where the combination of stops (/k/ and /d/), fricatives (/s/), and short vowels (/ɪ/)  create moments of silence in the speech flow, punctuating the word and making each syllable distinct. The initial fricative /s/ adds a hissing sound that leads into the abrupt stop /k/, creating a sharp onset that grabs attention. Overall, this creates a "up-down-up" sensation, achieved through the repetition of the short vowel /ɪ/ in each syllable and a rhythm of musicality and bounce, contributing to the word's memorability and ease of repetition.
<LB />
Rizz (/ɹɪz/): Rizz has a singular syllable structure, featuring the liquid consonant /ɹ/ as the onset, the lax vowel /ɪ/ as the nucleus, and the voiced fricative /z/ as the coda. This composition yields a smooth, fluid sound, with the /ɹ/ providing a roll into a sharper vowel. The ending /z/ introduces a buzzing sound, extending the vibration and leaving a lingering resonance.
<LB />

Gyat (/ɡjɑt/): The hard /ɡ/ onset immediately grabs attention, while the glide /j/ adds a transition to the open back vowel /ɑ/. The final stop /t/ cuts off the airflow and gives a punchy feeling to the word, making it impactful (as mentioned earlier).
<LB />

Ohio (/əʊˈhaɪ.oʊ/): The dynamics here are a bit less relevant to the popularity of the phrase lol, but overall it has a diphthong /aɪ/, and ends in a mirrored vowel sound to its beginning; the two /oʊ/ sounds gives a rounded effect to the word and does make it easier to remember.
<LB />

Looksmaxxing (/lʊks.mæks.ɪŋ/): Again, the dynamics seem to be less relevant than the semantics / absurdity of the meme, but some notable syllables here are the first, alveolar lateral approximant /l/ to the fricative /s/, and second syllables, /mæks/, emphasizes the action of maximizing, with the nasal /m/ leading into the open front unrounded vowel /æ/ and closing with the same /k/ and /s/ sounds as the first syllable.
<LB />

Mew (/mjuː/): The dynamics here are much more relevant, where he simplicity of "mew," with its initial bilabial nasal /m/ that transitions into the palatal approximant /j/ and the long close back rounded vowel /uː/, creates a smooth, continuous sound that is easy to articulate.
<LB />

Mog (/mɑg/): "Mog," another monosyllabic word, starts with the nasal /m/, followed by the open back unrounded vowel /ɑ/, and ends with the voiced velar stop /g/. This creates a solid grounded effect, reflective of the word's meaning of outclassing or overshadowing someone in physical appearance.
<LB />

Pookie (/ˈpuː.ki/): "Pookie" is very tied to its meaning by creating a affectionate, playful sound - he initial syllable /puː/ features a long close back rounded vowel that gives the word a soft, elongated start. The second syllable /ki/ ends with a crisp, light sound, making the word overall appear to give a feeling of warmth and closeness.
<LB />

Grimace (/ˈɡrɪm.əs/): The dynamic here is less relevant to its semantics for popularity (due to its absurdity and meaning of disgust), where it has a voiced velar stop /ɡ/, followed by a short, relaxed vowel /ɪ/, and a nasal /m/ that transitions into a schwa /ə/ and ends with a sibilant /s/.
<LB />

Yap (/jæp/): "Yap" is characterized by its quick, sharp delivery which also relates a lot to its semantics, starting with the palatal approximant /j/ that transitions rapidly into the open front unrounded vowel /æ/, and concludes with the bilabial plosive /p/. This causes it to be a sharp vocalization, effectively mirroring the high-pitched, quick sounds typically associated with small dogs' barking.
<LB />

Pog (/pɑg/): “Pog” is also another similar one where it has a bilabial plosive /p/, followed by open back unrounded vowel /ɑ/, and concludes with the voiced velar stop /g/. This quick sound characterizes its semantics of excitement.
<LB />

W (Dub) (/dʌb/) and L: These are more examples of monosyllabic words, which are more unique in structure - the voiced alveolar stop /d/ combined with the open-mid back unrounded vowel /ʌ/ and the bilabial plosive /b/ creates a quick motion that can be thought of as decisiveness (i.e., a victory or loss). 
<LB />

Griddy (/ˈɡrɪ.di/): Similar to skibidi, it uses a voiced velar stop /ɡ/, rolling into the short, relaxed vowel /ɪ/, and ending with a voiced alveolar stop /d/ followed by another /ɪ/. This creates a rhythmic effect that mirrors the dance move that’s implied here.
<LB />

Let Him Cook: Being more of a phrase, we can do a more general analysis here - it combines articulatory actions of the consonants and vowels in "let" (/lɛt/), "him" (/hɪm/), and "cook" (/kʊk/) where the emphasis is on the velar plosive /k/ in "cook", as it has the semantics of necessitating someone to ‘cook’ !
<LB />

Slay (/slɛj/): This has a initial consonant cluster /sl/ sliding into the diphthong /ɛj/, producing a sound that is sleek, which is relevant to its use cases, as it’s typically used where the /ɛj/ sound is elongated with an emphasis on its fluidity. 
<LB />

Glaze (/ɡleɪz/): Glaze has a voiced velar stop /ɡ/, leading into the diphthong /eɪ/, and ending with the voiced alveolar fricative /z/. The emphasis on /eɪ/ characterizes the act of giving someone a lot of praise, where it gives off the impression of  layering or adding a sheen, aligning with the metaphorical use of the word in social contexts.
<LB />

Womp Womp (/wɒmp wɒmp/): Womp womp has a bilabial /w/ leading into the open back rounded vowel /ɒ/, and concludes with the bilabial plosive /mp/. This is meant to sound like a sad trombone, echoing the comedic or sarcastic undertone of disappointment often associated with its use.
<LB />

Sus (/sʌs/): Sus begins and ends with a voiceless alveolar sibilant /s/, enclosing the open-mid back unrounded vowel /ʌ/. This is notably sharp and concise, which characterizes the sudden suspicion that may occur in the context of an Among Us game when players vote on an imposter. The central /ʌ/ sound opens up the word briefly, creating a brief suspense before the closing /s/ sound. Additionally, the /s/ sound can be attributed to the hissing of snakes, which has historically been associated with secrecy, skepticism, and doubt, making "sus" phonetically adept at conveying a sense of unease or mistrust in a compact form.
