In addition to the fluidity of Gen Alpha slang memes, we note that they can also function as pragmatic markers for hedging or affirmation. For instance, “hella sus” uses “hella” as a hedge, while “Facts!” can serve as a strong affirmation.

<LB />
These slang memes are also very much built upon their deixis, which can be observed in terms such as:
<ul>
    <li>“Sus” - originally derived from “suspicious,” with its meaning extending beyond simply describing doubt to implicitly signify a breach of social norms or expectations
</li>
    <li>“Skibidi” - referring to a variety of references (i.e., the skibidi toilet video, Yasin’s TikTok) that somehow constitutes the implied meaning of “someone bad”
</li>
</ul>
    </div>
  )
}
