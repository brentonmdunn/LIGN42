      We found that the majority of conversational meme terms are either (1) monosyllabic, which makes it easy to say, or (2) multisyllabic with an emphasis on the first syllable. Based on our analysis, we believe that roti /ɹoti/ will be the next Gen Alpha meme. 

      <LB />
      Currently, “cook” in a sentence can have different connotations. “I’m cooked”, for example, means that I am done or in trouble. We discussed earlier how “cook” in “Let him cook” has an entirely different meaning. Lastly, “cook” can simply mean cooking food. We determined that roti is a verb and will be derived from “rotisserie”, which is a style of roasting meat. Similar to the word cook in the phrase “I’m cooked”, roti has a negative connotation.

      Roti /ɹo.ti/ has two syllables:
      <ul>
        <li>/ɹo/: /ɹ/ is the onset and /o/ is the nucleus. This syllable has the most emphasis.</li>
        <li>/ti/: /t/ is the onset and /i/ is the nucleus</li>
      </ul>
    
    
    </div>
  )
}
