      We found that the majority of conversational meme terms are either (1) monosyllabic, which makes it easy to say, or (2) multisyllabic with an emphasis on the first syllable. Based on our analysis, we believe that roti /ɹoti/ will be the next Gen Alpha meme.

      Currently, “cook” in a sentence can have different connotations. “I’m cooked”, for example, means that I am done or in trouble. We discussed earlier how “cook” in “Let him cook” has an entirely different meaning. Lastly, “cook” can simply mean cooking food. We determined that roti is a verb and will be derived from “rotisserie”, also known as spit-roasting, is a style of roasting where meat is skewered on a spit – a long, solid rod used to hold food while it is being cooked over a fire in a fireplace or over a campfire, or roasted in an oven. Similar to the word cook in the phrase “I’m cooked”, roti has a negative connotation. Rather than saying “I’m cooked”, one could say “I’m rotied” to describe that they are in trouble. Furthermore, because of the implied skewered on a spit, we can also see that the user of “rotied” are “screwed”

      Roti /ɹo.ti/ has two syllables:
      <ul>
        <li>/ɹo/: /ɹ/ is the onset and /o/ is the nucleus. This syllable has the most emphasis.</li>
        <li>/ti/: /t/ is the onset and /i/ is the nucleus</li>
      </ul>
      Morphomemes: The morphomemes would also sound phonetically similar to the morphomemes of “cook”. However the only difference between those morphomemes and these morphomemes is that these ones are not actual/real words like the ones for “cook” are. So similar to “cook” there will not be that many morphomemes for the new slang word. These morphomemes would include:
      <ul>
        <li>Roti</li>
        <li>Rotied</li>
      </ul>
    
    </div>
