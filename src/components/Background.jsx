                Sticking out your gyat for the rizzler, you’re so skibidi, y
                ou’re so fanum tax. Can you believe that this is a real song? 
                Can you understand the meaning of that sentence? Gen Z and 
                Millennials alike have been amazed, and sometimes even 
                dumbfounded, by the new meme words coming from Gen Alpha. As Gen 
                Alpha’s presence on social media increases, we have seen various 
                terms be created while terms that were popular among Gen Z are 
                “out” or cringe.
            </p>
            <p>
                With this project, our goal is to analyze Gen Alpha’s most 
                popular meme words right now. We will compare the sound patterns 
                and syllables of each word, in order to predict what could be 
                the next meme word. 
            </p>
            <h3>Why is Gen Alpha humor so important?</h3>
            <p>
                Gen Alpha was given technology and access to the internet at a very young age, which is obviously earlier than any other generation. Because of this, they’ve developed their own distinct sense of humor and “meme culture”. We believe that such meme culture needs to be studied, in order to understand how this new generation thinks right now and how they will think in the future.</p>
            <h3>How do we define Gen Alpha memes?</h3>
            <p>We categorized meme words by the time they were popularized. Since we know that the Gen Alpha age range is defined to start in the early 2010s until 2025, we can estimate that the earliest among Gen Alpha began being “online” around 2020. Therefore, memes created by Gen Alpha would start becoming popular around this time as well. We are specifically focusing on memes that are commonly used in speech.</p>
