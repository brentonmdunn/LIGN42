        Through our research, we’ve discovered several areas that could be expanded on with data collection. For one, instead of using words we found through established articles and social media, we could gather data from search trends for certain periods of time.

        Since Gen Alpha has only recently come “online”, we would be able to have more conversational linguistic data if this study was to be conducted later. The last Gen Alphas will be babies born in 2025, so we estimate that they will be joining social media and the meme culture around the year 2035.

    It is crucial that we continue to try to understand this next generation of memes. By understanding the distinct humor that Gen Alpha has created, we are able to gain valuable insight into the continuously evolving nature of social media and the broader cultural dynamics that shape our digital world. Ultimately, the rise of Generation Alpha memes signals not just a simple trend, but a significant milestone in the ongoing evolution of the internet.
