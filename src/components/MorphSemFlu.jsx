        <h2><span>Morphological and Semantic Fluidity
</span></h2>

The evolution of words also demonstrates a high degree of morphological flexibility and innovation - i.e., “rizz” to “rizzler”/”rizzing” show that Gen Alpha slang, in general, is not simply static but dynamically adapts and expands to fit new contexts and meanings. This can be seen in the versatility that many slang terms exhibit in their grammatical functions. Here are a few instances:


        <LB />
        <ul>
            <li> Zero Derivation / Conversion

                <ul>
                <li>
                Sus: can act as an adjective (“that’s sus”) or a verb (“don’t sus me out”)

                </li>
                <li>
                Mog: as a verb, (“to mog someone”), and a noun, (“a mog”)

                </li>
            </ul></li>

            <li>Compounding
                
                <ul>
                <li>
                “looksmaxxing” from “looks” + “maximizing”

                </li>
            
            </ul>
            </li>
<li> Zero Derivation / Conversion

                <ul>
                <li>
                Sus: can act as an adjective (“that’s sus”) or a verb (“don’t sus me out”)

                </li>
                <li>
                Mog: as a verb, (“to mog someone”), and a noun, (“a mog”)

                </li>
            </ul></li>



            <li>Clipping & Blends


                <ul>
                <li>
                “Gyat” being a slurred version of “god damn” as a phonological simplification and semantic shift

                </li>
                <li>
                “Pog” being a clipped form of “pogchamp”

                </li>
            </ul></li>
            
        </ul>
        We can also see more of this slang-like behavior with phrases such as “big yikes” and “no cap” for ellipsis (omission of words) and implicature.

Additionally, these words apply to a much broader scope of addressing cultural phenomena (i.e.,  “looksmaxxing”, “mew”/“mewing”). Words such as “pog” and “sus” have evolved past their gaming contexts (Twitch & Among Us communities), as seen in examples of usage within wider applications of digital communication trends. Additionally, memes that would appear to be more contextually niche, such as “Ohio” and “Griddy” have been extended beyond literal definitions to encapsulate experiences, jokes, or shared knowledge as digital media evolves (transition of words from platforms like TikTok to the playground illustrate this). A more extreme case of evolution could be the shift in meanings of terms like “skibidi” from its original context to someone or something negative (which we still don’t really understand? lol). Still, they retain conversational markers that can be attributed to certain internet subcultures (i.e., pog &#8594; Twitch, etc.).
