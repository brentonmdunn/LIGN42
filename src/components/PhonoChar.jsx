        We hypothesize that this preference for monosyllabic words reflects a broader linguistic trend towards efficiency and ease of articulation, a principle that’s also seen in the phonological features of AAVE, such as consonant cluster reductions and the use of “-in” instead of “-ing.” This is reflected in frequent use cases of some of our words, such as “yap” is frequently used as “yappin” (i.e., “What is blud yappin’ about?”). These simplifications make words quicker and easier to say, enhancing communication speed and fluidity, which is particularly valued in informal, fast-paced, digital environments. In addition, it can be noted that the monosyllabic dominance can be attributed to not only ease of pronunciation, but also impact - where this single-syllable structure leads to a more punchy and memorable impact and hence making these words more viral in social media contexts.

        We can also note that in multisyllabic words, such as “Skibidi” and “Looksmaxxing,” the tendency for initial stress may aid in memorability and ease of articulation. For example, “Skibidi” (/ˈskɪ.bɪ.di/) may draw attention with its first stressed syllable, making the word more engaging and dynamic.

        Our words, such as “rizz” and “gyat” have phonetic structures that stand out within the English language. For instance, the use of the voiced alveolar sibilant /z/ in "rizz" is relatively rare in English, particularly at the end of monosyllabic words, contributing to its phonological uniqueness. Similarly, "gyat" incorporates a glide /j/ followed by a low back rounded vowel /ɑ/, creating a sound pattern that is both notable and expressive.
