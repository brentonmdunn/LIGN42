      Shortened from charisma, rizz can be used as a noun to describe the amount of charisma, or likeability, one has. Alternatively it can be used as a verb, for example, in the sentence “He is going to rizz her up,” we see that the meaning of rizz is someone trying to be charismatic toward someone else. Similarly, we have the term “rizzler” which is the person who has rizz, or the person who has charisma. Like many of Gen Alpha’s most popular slang words, rizz was popularized by streamer Kai Cenat and his streaming group to describe their abilities to woo women on their live streams.

      Rizz /ɹɪz/ is a singular syllable: /ɹ/ is the onset, /ɪ/ is the nucleus, and /z/ is the coda. Since few words in the English language end with “z” (175 in total!), and only one syllable, “rizz” is a memorable word that is interesting to say.

      Morphomemes: Originally stemming from “charisma”, rizz has diverged slightly from its origin in terms of part of speech and usage. Acceptable forms of rizz are:
      <ul>
        <li>Rizzler (adj)</li>
        <li>Rizzed (verb, past tense)</li>
        <li>Rizzing (verb, present participle)</li>
        <li>Rizzaholic (noun)</li>
        <li>Rizzful (adj)</li>
      </ul>
      Examples:
      <ul>
        <li>“I heard he was going to rizz her up before going to the dance”.</li>
        <li>“By laying his jacket down across the puddle, he was observed to have thoughtful rizz”.</li>
        <li>“It’s crazy how the rizzler got rizzed by someone as rizzful as him”</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
