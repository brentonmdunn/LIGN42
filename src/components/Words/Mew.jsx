        “Mewing is the practice of placing the tongue against the roof of the mouth to improve jaw alignment and change the shape and look of the jawline and face.” (USA Today) It is known to be a part of looksmaxxing, in order to make one’s jawline appear sharper. Although the term originated as a medical term, “mewing”, as well as the technique of mewing became popular with Gen Alpha through Tiktok memes and videos of people refusing to speak in order to keep their “mewing streaks,” then followed by showcasing their jawline. This trend is closely related to mogging, as it is accepted as one of the mogging techniques.
