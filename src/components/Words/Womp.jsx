        Womp womp is more of a sound than an actual word or phrase. It is derived from the sad trombone noise that is played during comedy shows from the 1900s, usually when a joke was bad and/or didn’t make the crowd laugh. In memes though, it carries a connotation of sarcasm and is used to make fun of one’s mishaps in a joking manner. The womp womp sound is supposed to be used light-heartedly and not taken too seriously.

            <LB />
        </p>
    </div>
