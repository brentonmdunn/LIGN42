        Womp womp is more of a sound (<Cite source='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKdcjJoXeEY' />) than an actual word or phrase. It is derived from the sad trombone noise that is played during comedy shows from the 1900s, typically used as indicator of a joke was bad and/or didn’t make the crowd laugh. In modern memes culture, it carries a connotation of sarcasm and is used to make fun of one’s mishaps in a joking manner. The womp womp sound is supposed to be used light-heartedly and not taken too seriously. 

            <LB />
            Womp /wɒmp/ by itself is monosyllabic: /w/ is the onset, /ɒ/ is the nucleus, and /mp/ is the coda.

          Morphomemes: Since womp womp is a sound rather than a word with a specific meaning, we just say womp womp as it is. Womp also typically have appear in pair of two, no more no less.
