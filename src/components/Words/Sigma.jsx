        On the other hand, a sigma wolf is powerful yet rebellious. They supposedly have the same power as alphas, but are not a part of the wolf pack. As hustle culture has spread, the concepts of sigma males and the sigma grindset have become popular as well. Since sigma wolves are just as powerful as the alphas, sigmas are supposed to be popular even without being inside the hierarchy. The image below depicts this hierarchy. We see alphas and sigmas at the top, and betas under them. Delta, gamma, and omega wolves are not seen in memes, though.

            Sigma /sɪg.mə/ has two syllables:
            <ul>
                <li>
                /sɪg/: /s/ is the onset, /ɪ/ is the nucleus, and /g/ is the coda. This syllable has the most emphasis.

                </li>
                <li>
                /mə/: /m/ is the onset and /ə/ is the nucleus

                </li>
            </ul>

            Sigma is most often used when talking about wolves or human males.

            Alpha, beta, and sigma all have pretty similar syllable structures. They each have two syllables and they all end with /ə/. This could be because of their origin, as they are all a part of the Greek alphabet.
