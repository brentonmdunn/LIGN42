        Beta wolves are the underlings of alpha wolves. They tend to be weaker than alphas and are the “followers”, as they must submit to the alphas. In general, it is seen as negative to be called a beta.

        Beta /beɪ.tə/ has two syllables:

        <ul>
            <li>
            /beɪ/: /b/ is the onset and /eɪ/ is the nucleus

            </li>
            <li>
            /tə/: /t/ is the onset and /ə/ is the nucleus

            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
  )
}
