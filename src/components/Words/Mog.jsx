        When you mog someone, it means you look better than someone else. For example, saying “He’s being mogged!” while looking at a picture would mean that the “he” in question looks far less attractive than the other person in the frame. However, the dictionary definition of mog is to depart or move away from something. The term was popularized by the looksmaxxing community, which strives to mog others by appearing more masculine, and therefore attractive. There are a few distinct etymologies for mog. One in particular (<Cite source='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mog#Etymology_1' />) believes that mog was derived from AMOG, or Alpha Male of the Group. This etymology ties the looksmaxxing origin with alpha and sigma wolf memes that are also popular among Gen Alpha.

The term mogging can also be the substrings of other looksmaxing terminology. These other terms where mogging is a substring usually refers to the physical trait where one individual shines over others including skullmogging, jawmogging, and chinmogging (which mean that one’s skull is better than others, one’s jaw is better, and one’s chin is better, respectively). These variations also have a -maxxing version. So while skullmogging, jawmogging, and chinmogging refer to having the better/best skull/jaw/chin than the other people that are surrounding that certain person, jawmaxxing, chinmaxxing, and skullmaxxing, means that you are working to maximize the looks of these rather than already having the best look.

Mog /mɑg/ is a singular syllable: /m/ is the onset, /ɑ/ is the nucleus, and /g/ is the coda. Mog is similar in structure to mew, as they both start with /m/ and are monosyllabic. Both were derived from the looksmaxxing community. When one mews, one also tends to mog others. One who mogs others most likely mews, but one who mews does not necessarily mog others. These word mog implies mew, but the word mew does not imply mog.
