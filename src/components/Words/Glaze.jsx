        Glaze is a verb describing the action of overly sucking up to someone. The term was popularized by Youtubers and Twitch streamers like Kai Cenat and xQc. According to Know Your Meme (<Cite source="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/glazing-slang" />), glazing “follows the visual of a donut being glazed”. For example, Kai Cenat “glazing” someone else would mean he is overly praising or hyping up someone too much.
