        <h3>Ohio</h3>

        <p>

        Ohio is a U.S. state that is often the center of mockery because of associations with the idea of midwestern states being boring. In around 2016, the “only in Ohio” meme began to circulate, poking fun at the idea of the whole state being strange and sinister (ref). However, the gen alpha obsession with Ohio is almost inexplicable. Grammatically, its use in sentences is just as bizarre. One example of this is heard in the following video: “give me your Ohio.” There is no concrete explanation for what “Ohio” means here. However, this inside joke among the gen alpha community has stuck around, proving that semantics are not always necessary for a meme to be successful.

        Ohio /əʊˈhaɪəʊ/ has three syllables:
        <ul>

            <li>/əʊ/: /ə/ is the nucleus and /ʊ/ is the coda</li>
            <li>/ˈhaɪ/: /h/ is the onset, /aɪ/ is the nucleus</li>
            <li>/əʊ/: /ə/ is the nucleus and there is no coda</li>




        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
  )
}
