        <h3>Skibidi</h3>
        <p>
        Contrary to popular belief, the origins of the word skibidi actually predated Skibidi Toilet. The actual meme that involves the word skibidi comes from a viral TikTok by Yasin Cengiz where a middle eastern TikToker bounced his belly to the chorus of the song CHUPKI V KRUSTA by Russian music artist FIKI. From this initial success, many more of similar TikToks would be made by the same creator, spiraling into a popular trend for a while. The song’s catchy tune and lyrics that roll off the tongue made the sound very popular and eventually influenced the creation of Skibidi Toilet.

        Skibidi Toilet arose as an animated web series on Youtube created by DaFuq!?Boom!. The series went viral, and many memes have come from it. Wikipedia calls it “Generation Alpha's first foray into internet culture” While the characteric head-coming-from-a-toilet has its own spinoff of memes, we are more concerned with the usage of “skibidi” in conversation. In conversation, it is mostly used ironically. However, like many other memes, skibidi has somewhat spun off from its original meaning, and has come to mean, at least in some circles, “someone who is evil or bad”

        <ul>
            <li>/skɪ/: /sk/ is the onset, /ɪ/ is the nucleus. This syllable has the most emphasis.</li>
            <li>/bɪ/: /b/ is the onset, /ɪ/ is the nucleus</li>
            <li>/di/: /d/ is the onset, /i/ is the nucleus</li>
        
        </ul>
            
        Change over time: Skibidi originally started as something that one said ironically or to gain attention. However, it has become and adjective meaning “someone who is bad or evil”  (<Cite source='https://www.quora.com/Why-does-my-son-keep-asking-if-I-have-Skibidi-rizz-Is-this-a-bad-thing' />)

        Compared to many, Similar to rizz, there are few words that sound similar to skibidi, so it is very unique. Although it is not monosyllabic, skibidi is definitely fun to say, and has an interesting structure.

        Because it is not monosyllabic compared to many other words in the Gen Alpha vocabulary, we can analyze the enunciation of the word. We can see that for skibidi, the word is said with the emphasis/accent on the first syllable. The emphasis/accent is further strengthened by the consonant sound the first syllable makes. The first syllable /skɪ/ has a hard -kuh sound, which to the ear can sound more sudden and abrupt. Also, the fact that two of the three syllables make assonance with the /ɪ/ with three easy consonants to complement it makes the word easy and in a way “addictive” to say. If a word is hard to pronounce, why put in the effort to pronounce it at all? Although many Gen Alpha meme words are one syllable long, “skibidi” somehow maintains a foundation in Gen Alpha meme vocabulary due to its unique origin and unique and catchy pronunciation.
