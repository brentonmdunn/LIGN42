        Derived from suspicious, sus means weird or out of place. The term comes from Among Us, a video game that was wildly popular amongst Youtube and Twitch streamers during Covid between 2020 and 2022. It is a shortened form of "suspicious" or "suspect." In its original usage in Among Us, "sus" was used to express distrust towards other players. However, due to its widespread use and adaptation in various contexts, the meaning of sus has evolved. It is now used more broadly to describe anything that seems questionable, rather than suspicious behavior. It can also be used as an adjective to describe someone suspicious or untrustworthy. 

            <LB />
            Sus /sʌs/ is monosyllabic: /s/ is the onset, /ʌ/ is the nucleus, and /s/ is the coda.
            <LB />
            Morphomemes: Sus has since been derived into “sussy” as in the phrase “sussy baka.”
