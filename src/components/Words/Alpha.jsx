        An alpha wolf is the leader of the pack. When someone calls themselves an alpha, it means that they are better or more powerful than the others in the group. Memes involving alpha wolves tend to be ironic, with images or videos usually depicting one acting as a powerful individual exerting their power to dominate others. The following is a great example of this:
        <LB />

        <img src={alphaimage} />
        <LB />
        Alpha wolf memes have gained popularity recently, even though the idea of wolf pack hierarchy has been around for a long time (seen in media such as Teen Wolf). This gave way to alpha male memes, which show males that are trying to show that they are powerful leaders. The original idea was that males use this kind of thinking as a mindset to reach their goals of becoming more powerful. However, many of the people who were “serious” about being alpha males used it as an excuse to act childishly, violently,and misogynistically. As a result, the term “alpha” was coined as a meme term used to describe oneself or others ironically.

        Alpha /æl.fə/ has two syllables: 
        <ul>
            <li>/æl/: /æ/ is the nucleus and /l/ is the coda</li>
            <li>/fə/: /f/ is the onset and /ə/ is the nucleus</li>
        </ul>

        <LB />
        Alpha is most often used when talking about wolves or human males.
