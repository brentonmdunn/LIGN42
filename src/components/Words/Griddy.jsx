        "The Griddy" is a dance move where a person taps their heels in alternation while walking or in place, and swings both their arms back and forth in unison. The dance also involves forming imaginary goggles. Allen Davis, a high school football player, created the dance in 2018, and it went viral on TikTok in 2019. Davis first shared his dance routines on Snapchat, and Ja'Marr Chase, his friend, began using them as a celebratory motion while playing for LSU.
