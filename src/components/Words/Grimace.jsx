                The Grimace Shake is a limited edition, supposedly berry-flavored milkshake that the popular fast-food chain McDonald created to celebrate Grimace Birthday, a fictional mascot. 

This very oddly purple, and overly sweet drink have starred in many short videos, whomst all follows the motive of folks trying out the beverage, which then suddenly cut to a horrific scene depicting gruesome death, with discarded cup of the shake. Besides gooey death, the Grimace Shake has been shown to induce heavy intoxication, demonic possession, and insanity. Some splash the milkshake on their clothes and surroundings to look like a crime scene, or rather, a "Grime Scene," dubbing Grimace a "Griminal."

        This meme was heavily inspired by a different food-related trend, where users would pretend to fall ill after eating the “Spider-verse Whopper”, with implication of illness caused by the odd color of the item.
