        Let Him Cook, also known as Let That Boy Cook, is a slang term and catchphrase used as a callout to give someone the space to plot, strategize or hone their craft. A common use of the term is to refer to someone's rizz or game when it comes to flirting, with "Let Him Cook" being a common response to a questionable hornypost. A popular variant of the meme uses the Woody Holding Sora Back template, from the popular video game series, Kingdom Hearts. The phrase is also used in American football discourse, especially in association with Seattle Seahawks player Russell Wilson and the Let Russ Cook meme. People also use the associated phrase "Who Let Him Cook?" as a way to question someone's hot take.

        The pronunciation of the word cook remained the same from the original meaning, which is to prepare food. This is also a peak in meme culture's obsession with cooking terms, which many of the terms have been adapted to have an additional meaning in meme culture. 

        Cook /kʊk/ is monosyllabic: /k/ is the onset, /ʊ/ is the nucleus, and /k/ is the coda.
