        <h3>Looksmaxxing</h3>

        <p>
        Looksmaxxing is the practice of maximizing one’s own looks to become more attractive. Methods include improving hygiene, working out more, or even mewing. Looksmaxxing is the most general term, but there are specific terms for the specific areas that are maximized. For example, if someone wants to only improve their facial features, they would be facemaxxing. The word looksmaxxing comes from the blending of “looks” or “face”, or whatever feature is being targeted and “maxxing”, which is shortened from “maximizing”.

        The term “looksmaxxing” also inspired many spinoff terms due to the goofy-maxxed nature of the word. As people realize how silly the word looksmaxxing was due to the not so subtle definition of maxxing one’s look, people  started to combine the suffix -maxxing(?) with other words. Some of these other terms include chinmaxxing and yippeemaxxing. The quirkyness of origins of the term “looksmaxxing” inspired a whole subset of new terms like “mogging” which has similar effects on the Gen Alpha vocabulary.
