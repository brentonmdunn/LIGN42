        Slay is believed to have originated from the African American LGBTQ+ community (<Cite source='https://later.com/social-media-glossary/slay/' />) and originally meant to impress or amuse (<Cite source='https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=slay+defintio' />). Its use in meme culture is very similar, with Urban Dictionary (<Cite source='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=slay'/>) defining it as “killed it. Succeeded in something amazing”.
