The term has kept specific elements of the original meaning, specifically continuous and sound producing, and adapted it to explain a specific kind of individual. To Yap is to speak without discretion at length to an uninterested audience resulting in discomfort, annoyance, and/or discontent, and those excelled at this technique is referred to as Yapper.
