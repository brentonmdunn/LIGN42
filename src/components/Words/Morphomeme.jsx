        <h3>Morphomeme</h3>
        <p>We will define “morphomeme” to mean a variation of a meme. This includes any variations that stem from a “base meme”. Later, we see that “rizz” is the base meme and is a noun, but words such as “rizzler” (noun) and “rizzful” (adjective) were derived from rizz. </p>
