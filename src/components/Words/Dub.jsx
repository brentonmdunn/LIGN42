        <p>
        (W) Dub, derived from the first syllable of the pronunciation of the letter “w”, or /ˈdʌb l̩ yu/, or  /ˈdʌb /. Which to signal victory, winning, or an achievement of some sort, even ironically. 

        <LB />
        L, pronounced like the letter, is simply because it is the first letter of the word “loser”. The usage of the L to signal a Loser started as playground insults, as individuals would form an L with their right hand, and place it in front of their forehead. L further gain popularity through one of the meme-est song of the last few decade, All Star by smashmouth, where the lyrics goes “She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an "L" on her forehead” 
        <LB />
        Both W (Dub) and L are both monosyllabic, and they naturally roll off the tongue for many English speakers given that they are both part of the language alphabet.

        Examples:
        <ul>
          <li>
          “We won our game, what a W”

          </li><li>“We lost our match, such an L”

</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
